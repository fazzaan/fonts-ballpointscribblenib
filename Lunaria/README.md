## Lunaria con-script font

### About Lunaria

Lunaria is a cypher conscript for English, designed by Redditor BallpointScribbleNib.  

Lunaria cypher conscript supports all Latin-English letters except for K.  

K is used as the modifier letter, and all instances of /k/ are spelled using C.  

Primary digraphs ⟨ch⟩ ⟨sh⟩ ⟨th⟩ are spelled as [ck] [sk] [tk].  

Play around with [k] to find some phonological Easter eggs!  

### Script support
* Latin English as per script creator's orthography
* The Greek alphabet too!
* NewEng, the font creator's con-orthography
* Dozenal, the base-12 numerical system


#### About the files
* OTF is the newer font format and has a smaller size and better features.
* TTF is the older font format and has better compatibility with all devices. 
* Use TTF if you will install it on your phone. 
* Use the zip file if you plan to import the font to the Android keyboard app, [Keyboard Designer](https://www.keyboarddesigner.com/) (note that the paid version of the app is required in order to import your own fonts. It's not expensive though. It's also the only app I've found that actually supports personal fonts).

#### Changelog 

v 1.000 - First functional release!
* Added substitution rules for all digraphs. Digraphs are typed using K as the modifier: ⟨ch⟩ is [ck]; ⟨th⟩ is [tk]; ⟨sh⟩ is [sk].
* Play around with the letter k for some easter eggs! o͜  o 
* Btw this font also contains all glyphs for Greek. I've created glyphs based on yours that are suitable for the Greek phonology.
