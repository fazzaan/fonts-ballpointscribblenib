# BallpointScribbleNib's cipher fonts
_fonts-ballpointscribblenib_  
_A collection of cipher-script fonts for reddit neographer BallpointScribbleNib_  

As part of my ongoing font-development skill honing, I reached out on Reddit in January 2026 to find people who wanted their con-scripts and con-alphabets digitised into function fonts that they could install and use on their computers and other devices.  

u/BallpointScribbleNib has designed several neoscripts, most of which are technically cyphers for the Latin-English alphabet.  

This repository will host the fonts I produce for their scripts.
